  How Cells Make Sense of their Surroundings</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">The development and maintenance of tissue pattern arises from 
  spatially localized modulation of cellular cues, including soluble cytokines, 
  extracellular matrix, intercellular adhesion, and mechanical forces. We are 
  investigating how the interactions between these cues cooperate mechanically 
  and biochemically to regulate endothelial and smooth muscle cell function. We 
  have developed microfabrication approaches originally developed in the semiconductor 
  industry to generate spatially patterned cellular microenvironments with well-controlled 
  variations in surface chemistry, adhesivity, and mechanics at cellular and subcellular 
  length scales. Using these tools, we are investigating how cells interrogate 
  and respond to their local environment. In particular, we are interested in 
  understanding how integrins, cadherins, growth factors, and mechanical cues 
  cooperate to control cytoskeletal structure and mechanics, cell proliferation, 
  and differentiation. Thus, we hope to better understand the fundamental mechanisms 
  that drive tissue organization, while building infrastructure to use microchips 
  to integrate, manipulate, and study living cells. </font></p>
