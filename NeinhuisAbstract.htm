<p><font size="4">The surfaces of plants are covered by a thin extracellular membrane, 
  the cuticle. In many species, the cuticle is covered by small wax structures 
  in the range of serval micrometers. This wax layer represents a multifunctional 
  interface between the plant and its environment. In recent years we intensively 
  studied the transport of lipid substances through the cuticle as well as self-assembly 
  processes leading to structure formation, the latest results of which will be 
  presented.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Microstructures are important for many surface funtions, especially 
  water repellency. While in smooth surfaces contact angles reach up to 110&deg;, 
  roughness in the dimensions of micrometers causes super-hydrophobicity with 
  contact angles up to 170&deg;. In such cases, the area for adhesion of water 
  is minimized and air is enclosed between the droplets and wax crystals. The 
  same holds true for particles. Again, the contact area between particle and 
  surface is minimized resulting in the adhesion of particles to the water droplets. 
  Independant of size and chemical nature, contaminations are removed from such 
  optimized surfaces with only a small amount of rain. Since this effect can be 
  beautifully demonstrated on the leaves of the sacred lotus, we called it Lotus-Effect. 
  Recent studies concentrate on the different types of surface structures in plants 
  in relation wetting properties.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">The Lotus-Effect depends only on physico-chemical properties 
  of the leaf surfaces. Therefore, we initiated a joint project together with 
  currently more than 12 industrial companies to transfer the Lotus-Effect into 
  products with biomimetic self-cleaning surfaces such as facade paints, roof 
  tiles, polymers or paints. </font> </p>
